## General Information
- This  programming assignment where you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Sharing of rented bikes.
- Through Regression we want to find what all features can help us to create a better bussiness model.
- Excel datasheet is provided by boom bikes containing various features.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Bike sharing bussiness mostly depends on natural factors.
- The season , working day ,temperature, weather these features play the most important role in rented bikes bussiness.
